Git url:
Notes app:

For this assignment we had to create an application in which we could create sticky notes, move them around, have them render markdown, and delete them.

While working with React was initially difficult, I feel like I understand the use and effectiveness of React much more now.

## Extra Credit
- Resize notes
- Use z index to layer notes
